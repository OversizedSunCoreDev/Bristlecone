//why do it this way?
//well, unfortunately, input in UE runs through the event loop.
//at high sample rates, this can blow the event loop to hell, 
//and it's always going to be dependent on the gamethread.
//at best, it's a tidge slow and tick-rate dependent.
//at worst, it goes boom. 
//Cabling is NOT a general purpose or complete solution. It is a thin layer
//provided as a jumping off point for working in this space.
